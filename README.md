POST creates an event within current day and with random start/end time. Event is placed on calendar depending on its time and duration. 
If events intersect, then they are displayed on different rows.

PREV and NEXT switch days. 

P.S. There is functionality to display long events that started on one day and finished on another, and they have to be added not randomly, but by using forms that are not currently made.
